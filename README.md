# CS 370: Machine Learning Pathfinder

## Project Overview
In this project, I was responsible for implementing the **Q-learning algorithm** and identifying the ideal exploration factor to find the optimal path through a maze with the minimum number of epochs. This project demonstrates the practical application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts, specifically how intelligent agents can learn optimal policies through trial and error within a defined environment.

## Course Reflection

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
In this course, I learned the importance of **Machine Learning (ML)**. It is a critical system in modern science. It represents not just market capitalization, but the very future of the industry and likely the world as a whole. If physics can help us explore the stars and oceans, then "learning to learn" will accelerate every intellectual function that interacts with artificial intelligence.

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer science isn't just about one facet of technology; it is about understanding how science can be extended through abstraction to automate tasks. Therefore, it is a computer scientist's job to uncover the underlying logic required to create repeatable approaches with consistent results, and then build systems that simplify the process in a functional manner.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems scientifically. Philosophically, I start by asking a question. I hypothesize about what needs to be done to reach the solution, then reverse engineer the abstractions to their approximate origin. From there, I work from the ground up using data and methods to achieve those objectives as benchmarks for measurable progress. Finally, I test the solution to ensure no bias or security risks are present.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to ensure the science upholds best practice standards. The work must abide by the law, and its application must ensure equality in its function. If one of these fails, the fault lies in either the implementation or the design of the algorithm.
